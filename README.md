# Uni-Notes
These are my notes for the five year theoretical physics MPyhs degree taught at the University of Edinburgh.
I started this course in 2018 and will graduate in 2023.

These notes are compiled based material delivered in lectures as well as the lecture notes provided, various textbooks, and other sources.

These notes are correct to the best of my knowledge but since they are my personal notes they are likely to contain errors, typos, and mistakes.
Please inform me if you find any sort of mistake or if you simply think that there is an improvement that could be made.
The notes assume knowledge of the courses from previous years and possibly of other courses run at the same time.
That said the notes should be fairly standalone for anyone with an equivalent amount of maths and/or physics education as I had at the time that I took the course.

If you have spotted a mistake, have a suggestion or improvement in mind or think something is badly written/explained please contact me, either by creating an issue or emailing me at s1824487@ed.ac.uk.
