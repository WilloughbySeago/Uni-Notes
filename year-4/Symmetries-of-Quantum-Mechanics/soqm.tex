    \part{Continuous Groups}
    \chapter{Lie Groups}
    \section{Background}
    Finite groups were first utilised by mathematicians, particularly Galois, who wanted to classify the solutions to polynomials.
    Groups were used to show that, in general, polynomials of degree 5 or greater don't admit an exact solution in terms of elementary functions.
    That is, there is no \enquote{quintic formula} equivalent to the quadratic formula.
    There are linear, cubic, and quartic versions of the quadratic formula, but the linear formula is trivial and the cubic and quartic formulae contain too many terms to be useful for human computations.
    The main focus was on the symmetric groups, since permuting variables in equations played a big part in classifying the solutions, and it was soon noticed that the basic symmetry operations of a group applied to a far more general class of algebraic objects.
    
    Sophus Lie introduced Lie groups, to be defined shortly, for similar reasons, he was attempting to classify solutions to differential equations.
    These have continuous solutions and so unsurprisingly Lie groups are continuous.
    
    All simple finite groups have been classified.
    Likewise all simple and compact Lie groups have been classified, we will see the classification later.
    
    \section{Basics}
    \begin{dfn}{Continuous Group}{}
        A \defineindex{continuous group} is a group, \(G\), with an uncountable number of elements which can be continuously parametrised by some set of parameters, \(\{\alpha\}\).
        We call the number of parameters the \define{dimension}\index{dimension!of a group} of \(G\), \(\dim G\).
    \end{dfn}
    Notice that it doesn't make sense to discus the order of a continuous group since it is infinite.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Lie Group}{}
        A \define{Lie group}\index{Lie!group} is a continuous group which admits an analytic structure in the parameters \(\{a\}\).
        
        Alternatively, a \define{Lie group} is a manifold equipped with a binary operation satisfying the group axioms.
    \end{dfn}
    For our purposes a manifold is a space which can be parametrised locally by a fixed number Euclidean coordinates.
    The number of coordinates is the dimension of the manifold.
    A fuller definition of a manifold is given in \cref{app:manifold}.

    All of the groups in the following definition are Lie groups.
    Technically, we are only defining a representation of these groups here but this is fine.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Specific Lie Groups}{}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \defineindex{general linear group}, \(\generalLinear(n, \field)\), is defined as the group of transformations of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over \(\field\), which is usually \(\reals\) or \(\complex\).
            It has the representation
            \begin{equation}
                \generalLinear(n, \field) \coloneqq \{M \in \matrices{n}{\field} \mid \det M \ne 0\}.
            \end{equation}
            The requirement of non-zero determinant is so that the matrices are invertible.
            
            \item The \defineindex{special linear group}, \(\specialLinear(n, \field)\), is defined as the group of transformations of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over \(\field\) which preserve volumes.
            It has the representation
            \begin{equation}
                \specialLinear(n, \field) \coloneqq \{M \in \matrices{n}{\field} \mid \det M \ne 1\} \subgroup \generalLinear(n, \field).
            \end{equation}
            
            \item The \defineindex{orthogonal group}, \(\orthogonal(n)\), is defined as the group of transformations of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over \(\reals\) which preserves lengths.
            It has the representation
            \begin{equation}
                \orthogonal(n) \coloneqq \{O \in \matrices{n}{\reals} \mid O^\trans O = \ident_n\} \subgroup \generalLinear(n, \reals).
            \end{equation}
            
            \item The \defineindex{special orthogonal group}, \(\specialOrthogonal(n)\), is defined as the group of transformations of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over \(\reals\) which preserves lengths and orientations.
            It has the representation
            \begin{equation}
                \specialOrthogonal(n) \coloneqq \{O \in \matrices{n}{\reals} \mid O^\trans O = \ident_n \text{ and } \det O = 1\}.
            \end{equation}
            It is a subgroup of both \(\orthogonal(n)\) and \(\specialLinear(n, \reals)\).
            
            \item The \defineindex{unitary group}, \(\unitary(n)\), is defined as the group of transformations of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over \(\complex\) which preserves inner products.
            It has the representation
            \begin{equation}
                \unitary(n) = \{U\in\matrices{n}{\complex} \mid U^\hermit U = \ident_n\} \subgroup \generalLinear(n, \complex).
            \end{equation}
            
            \item The \defineindex{special unitary group}, \(\specialUnitary(n)\), is defined as the group of transformations of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over \(\complex\) which preserves inner products and orientations.
            It has the representation
            \begin{equation}
                \specialUnitary(n) \coloneqq \{U \in \matrices{n}{\complex} \mid U^\hermit U = \ident_n \text{ and } \det U = 1\}.
            \end{equation}
            It is a subgroup of both \(\unitary(n)\) and \(\specialLinear(n, \complex)\).
            
            \item The \defineindex{symplectic group}\index{USp(2n)@\(\USp(2n)\), symplectic group of rank \(n\)}\index{SP(n)@\(\Sp(n)\), symplectic group of rank \(n\)}, \(\USp(2n) = \Sp(n)\), is defined as the group of transformations of an \(2n\)-dimensional vector space over \(\field\) which preserves symplectic bilinear forms\footnote{A \defineindex{symplectic bilinear form} is a map \(\omega\colon V\times V \to \field\) which is linear in both arguments, alternating, so \(\omega(x, y) = -\omega(y, x)\),  and non-degenerate, so \(\omega(u, v) = 0\) for all \(v \in V\) only if \(u = 0\). We can view \(\reals^{2n}\) as a symplectic space by endowing it with the map \(J\) defined above such that \(\omega(x, y) = x^{\hermit}Jy\).}.
            It has the representation
            \begin{equation}
                \USp(2n) = \Sp(n) \coloneqq \{S \in \matrices{2n}{\field} \mid S^{\hermit} J S = J\}
            \end{equation}
            where
            \begin{equation}
                J \coloneqq
                \begin{pmatrix}
                    0 & -\ident_n\\
                    -\ident_n & 0
                \end{pmatrix}
                .
            \end{equation}
            Note that \(J^2 = -\ident_{2n}\), so we can think of \(J\) as a generalisation of \(i\) which has \(i^2 = -1\).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{exm}{}{}
        The following are group actions of some Lie group on \(\reals^3\).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(\reals^3\) with vector addition as the group operation is an \(3\)-dimensional continuous group.
            The parameters can be seen as the components of the vectors.
            
            \item \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) with matrix multiplication as the group operation is a \(3\)-dimensional continuous group.
            The parameters can be seen as the three Euler angles defining a rotation.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{exm}
    
    It should be noted that the dimension of \(\specialOrthogonal(n)\) is not, in general, \(n\).
    For example, \(\specialOrthogonal(2)\) has dimension 1, since there is only one parameter defining rotations in the plane, the angle of the rotation.
    \(\specialOrthogonal(4)\) has dimension 6, since there are initially \(4^2 = 16\) degrees of freedom for the individual components of the matrix.
    It then turns out that orthogonality fixes one component in each row and column, since these must form unit vectors, and the requirement that the determinant is 1 fixes another three degrees of freedom.
    
    \section{Properties of Lie Groups}
    There are various properties which manifolds, and hence Lie groups, may or may not posses.
    In this section we cover some of these properties.
    
    \subsection{Basic Properties}
    \begin{dfn}{Finite or Infinite}{}
        A manifold is finite dimensional if it is parametrised by a finite number of coordinates.
        If this is not the case then the manifold is infinite dimensional.
        A Lie group is \define{finite}\index{finite dimensional Lie group} or \define{infinite dimensional}\index{infinite dimensional Lie group} if it is a finite or infinite dimensional manifold respectively.
    \end{dfn}
    \begin{exm}{}{}
        The Lie groups \(\unitary(1)\), \(\specialOrthogonal(2)\), \(\specialUnitary(2)\), and \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) are all finite dimensional.
        
        The Lie group \(\unitary(\hilbert)\) for an infinite dimensional Hilbert space is an infinite dimensional Lie group under the topology induced by the operator norm,
        \begin{equation}
            \norm{A}_{\mathrm{op}} \coloneqq \inf \{c \ge 0 \mid \norm{Av} \le c\norm{v} \text{ for all } v \in \hilbert\}
        \end{equation}
        where \(\norm{-}\) is the norm on \(\hilbert\).
        This norm can be thought of as the smallest number, \(c\), such that \(A\) doesn't scale the \enquote{length} of a vector by more than a factor of \(c\).
        For example, this Lie group might represent all unitary transformations on the state of a particle with a continuous parameter.
    \end{exm}
    
    \begin{dfn}{Real or Complex}{}
        A manifold is real if it is parametrised by real numbers with smooth maps, and complex if it is parametrised by complex numbers with holomorphic maps.
        A Lie group is \define{real}\index{real Lie group} or \define{complex}\index{complex Lie group} if it is a real or complex manifold, respectively.
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{dfn}{}{}
        The Lie groups \(\unitary(1)\), \(\specialOrthogonal(2)\), \(\specialUnitary(2)\), and \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) are real Lie groups, although we will later see that \(\specialUnitary(2)\) is pseudo-real.
    \end{dfn}

    \subsection{Compactness}    
    The following definition assumes the existence of a metric on the manifold.
    \begin{dfn}{Compact}{}
        A manifold, \(M\), is compact if it is closed and bounded.
        \define{Bounded}\index{bounded} means that \(d(x, y) < r\) for all \(x, y\) in the manifold and \(r \in \reals\) being some finite number with \(d\) being a metric.
        \define{Closed}\index{closed} means that when viewing \(M\) as a submanifold of some larger manifold \(M\) contains its boundary.
        A Lie group is \define{compact}\index{compact Lie group} if it is compact as a manifold and \define{non-compact}\index{non-compact Lie group} otherwise.
    \end{dfn}
    
    As an example consider \(\reals\) with the standard metric \(d(x, y) = \abs{x - y}\).
    Then \([0, 1] \coloneqq \{x \in \reals \mid 0 \le x \le 1\}\) is closed and bounded, and hence compact.
    The intervals
    \begin{align}
        [0, 1) &\coloneqq \{x \in \reals \mid 0 \le x < 1\},\\
        (0, 1] &\coloneqq \{x \in \reals \mid 0 < x \le 1\}, \qand\\
        (0, 1) &\coloneqq \{x \in \reals \mid 0 < x < 1\}
    \end{align}
    are not closed, but are bounded.
    The interval \([0, \infty) \coloneqq \{x \in \reals \mid x > 0\}\) is not bounded since the distance between points can become arbitrarily large.
    
    The circle, \(S^1\), is compact but \(\reals\) isn't.
    
    \begin{exm}{}{}
        The Lie groups \(\unitary(1)\), \(\specialOrthogonal(2)\), \(\specialUnitary(2)\), and \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) are compact Lie groups.
    \end{exm}
    
    For a compact group all of the theorems of \cref{chap:basics of representation theory}, such as Maschke's theorem (\cref{thm:maschke's theorem}), Schur's lemma (\cref{thm:schurs lemma}), and the decomposability theorem (\cref{thm:decomposability}), can be modified to hold for compact continuous groups.
    To do so we replace the sum over group elements, \(\sum_{g\in G}\), with the \defineindex{Haar measure}, \(\int \dl{\{\alpha\}}\), we won't go into detail here on this though.
    For this reason we will restrict ourselves to compact groups, although here we give a few examples of non-compact groups.
    
    \begin{exm}{Non-Compact Lie Group}{}
        Consider the translation group on \(\reals\).
        That is \(\reals\) acting on \(\reals\) by \(a \action x = x + a\).
        This has a representation, \(\rho \coloneqq \reals \to \generalLinear(V)\), given by the following:
        \begin{equation}
            \rho(a) =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                1 & a\\ 0 & 1
            \end{pmatrix}
            .
        \end{equation}
        However, this doesn't decompose since the subspace defined by the span \(\ve{x} = (1, 0)\) is an invariant subspace but its orthogonal complement, defined by the span of \(\ve{y} = (0, 1)\), is not invariant, since \(\rho(a)\ve{y} = (a, 1) \notin \spn \{\ve{y}\}\).
        Hence we cannot write \(\rho = \rho_1 \directsum \rho_2\) with \(\rho_1 \colon \reals \to \generalLinear(W)\) and \(\rho_2 \colon \reals \to \generalLinear(W^{\bot})\) with \(W \directsum W^{\bot} = V\), despite the fact that \(\rho\) is not irreducible.
        This is a failure of the decomposability theorem (\cref{thm:decomposability}) which holds only for compact groups.
    \end{exm}
    
    \begin{exm}{}{}
        The Lorentz group, \(\orthogonal(1, 3)\), is not compact.
        This is because it is parametrised in part by the relative velocity of the frames and this is restricted to the non-compact interval \([0, c)\).
        
        Maschke's theorem (\cref{thm:maschke's theorem}) doesn't hold for the Lorentz group as it has no finite dimensional unitary representations.
        This is why we need to define an invariant of the form \(\bar{\psi}\psi\) for spinors \(\psi\) with \(\bar{\psi} \coloneqq \psi^\hermit \gamma_0\) and \(\gamma_0 \coloneqq \ident_2 \directsum (-\ident_2) = \sigma_3 \directproduct \ident_2\).
        If \(\psi\) instead transformed under a finite dimensional unitary representation, which is guaranteed to exist for a compact group by Maschke's theorem (\cref{thm:maschke's theorem}) then this would not be necessary as \(\psi^\hermit \psi\) would be invariant without the need for \(\gamma_0\).
    \end{exm}
    
    \subsection{Connectedness}
    \begin{dfn}{}{}
        A manifold is connected if there exists a continuous path between any two points in the manifold.
        A manifold is simply connected if any loop can be contracted continuously to a point.
        A manifold is disconnected if it is not connected.
        A Lie group is \define{disconnected}\index{disconnected Lie group}, \define{connected}\index{connected Lie group}, or \define{simply connected}\defineindex{simply connected Lie group} if it is disconnected, connected, or simply connected as a manifold respectively.
    \end{dfn}
    
    Intuitively a space is simply connected if there are no holes.

    \begin{exm}{}{}
        The Lie groups \(\unitary(1)\), \(\specialOrthogonal(2)\), and \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) are connected.
        The Lie group \(\specialUnitary(2)\) is simply connected.
        The Lie group \(\orthogonal(2)\) is disconnected since there is no continuous path from \(O \in \orthogonal(2)\) with \(\det O = -1\) to \(O' \in \orthogonal\) with \(\det O' = +1\) since \(\det\) is a continuous function and must jump from \(-1\) to \(+1\) along this path somewhere since all orthogonal matrices have \(\abs{\det O} = 1\).
    \end{exm}
    
    \subsection{Simplicity}
    Recall that a finite group is simple if it has no non-trivial proper normal subgroups, and that a normal subgroup is one which is invariant under conjugation.
    That is, \(N \normalsubgroup G\) if \(gng^{-1} \in N\) for all \(n \in n\) and \(g \in G\).
    We define simple Lie groups in a similar way but we explicitly disallow a few cases.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Simple Lie Group}{}
        A Lie group is \define{simple}\index{simple group} if it is connected, non-Abelian, and has no non-trivial connected normal subgroups.
        
        A \defineindex{semi-simple Lie group} is a Lie group which can be written as a direct product of simple Lie groups.
        
        A \defineindex{composite Lie group} is a Lie group which can be written as a semi-direct product of simple Lie groups.
    \end{dfn}
    
    The reason we exclude more cases than for the definition for any group is motivated by the fact that it is not possible to define a quotient group from a simple group, apart from the trivial group and the simple group itself.
    We want this to hold replacing all groups with Lie groups.
    Importantly this means that we want a simple Lie group to be one where it is not possible to define a non-trivial quotient \emph{Lie} group.
    If we expand upon what this requires we get the definition above.
    
    We will only concern ourselves with simple Lie groups in this course.
    
    \begin{exm}{}{}
        The Lie groups \(\specialLinear(n)\), \(\specialUnitary(n)\), and \(\USp(2n) = \Sp(n)\) are simple.
    \end{exm}
    
    \subsubsection{Classification of Simple Compact Lie Groups}
    All simple compact Lie groups have been classified.
    It turns out there are four families of simple compact Lie groups, \(A_n\), \(B_n\), \(C_n\), and \(D_n\), and five exceptional groups, \(E_6\), \(E_7\), \(E_8\), \(F_4\), and \(G_2\) which don't fall into any of these categories.
    We won't define the exceptional groups here, we just note that they exist.
    The families consist of familiar groups, \(A_n = \specialUnitary(n + 1)\), \(B_n = \specialOrthogonal(2n + 1)\), \(C_n = \USp(2n)\), and \(D_n = \specialOrthogonal(2n)\).
    These are sorted by their rank, which is given by the subscript.
    Rank is a concept related to the Lie algebras of these groups, which we shall meet later.
    
    \begin{table}
        \begin{tabular}{lcc}\toprule
            Group & Dimension & Rank \\ \midrule
            \(A_n\) & \((n + 1)^2 - 1\) & \(n\)\\
            \(B_n\) & \(n(2n + 1)\) & \(n\)\\
            \(C_n\) & \(n(2n + 1)\) & \(n\)\\
            \(D_n\) & \(n(2n - 1)\) & \(n\)\\ \midrule
            \(E_6\) & 78 & 6\\
            \(E_7\) & 133 & 7\\
            \(E_8\) & 248 & 8\\
            \(F_4\) & 52 & 4\\
            \(G_2\) & 14 & 2\\ \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Classification of simple compact Lie groups}
    \end{table}
    
    \tikzset{dynkin node/.style = {fill = white}}
    \tikzset{->-/.style = {decoration={markings, mark=at position #1 with {\arrow{>}}}, postaction={decorate}}}
    \tikzset{-<-/.style = {decoration={markings, mark=at position #1 with {\arrow{<}}}, postaction={decorate}}}
    The Lie groups can be depicted by \define{Dynkin diagrams}\index{Dynkin diagram}, which are graphs with as many nodes as the rank of the group.
    For example, \(A_1\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-A1}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; }
    , \(A_2\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-A2}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    , and \(A_3\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-A3}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (0, 0) -- (2, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (2, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    .
    In general \(A_n\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-An}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (0, 0) -- (1.3, 0); \draw (1.7, 0) -- (3, 0); \draw[dotted] (1.3, 0) -- (1.7, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (2, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (3, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    with \(n\) nodes.
    
    The Dynkin  diagram for \(B_n\) is similar but the final connection is doubled and directed, so \(B_2\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-B2}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw[double, ->-=0.65, >=To] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    , and \(B_3\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-B3}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (-1, 0) -- (0, 0); \draw[double, ->-=0.65, >=To] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (-1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    .
    In general \(B_n\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-Bn}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (-2, 0) -- (-0.7, 0); \draw (-0.3, 0) -- (0, 0); \draw[dotted] (-0.7, 0) -- (-0.3, 0); \draw[double, ->-=0.65, >=To] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (-2, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (-1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    with \(n\) nodes.
    
    The Dynkin diagrams for \(C_n\) are almost identical to those of \(B_n\) but with the direction reversed, so \(C_2\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-C2}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw[double, -<-=0.65, >=To] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    , and \(C_3\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-C3}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (-1, 0) -- (0, 0); \draw[double, -<-=0.65, >=To] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (-1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    .
    In general \(C_n\) corresponds to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-Cn}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (-2, 0) -- (-0.7, 0); \draw (-0.3, 0) -- (0, 0); \draw[dotted] (-0.7, 0) -- (-0.3, 0); \draw[double, -<-=0.65, >=To] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (-2, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (-1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius =0.075]; }
    with \(n\) nodes.
    
    The Dynkin diagrams for \(D_n\) branch at the end into two.
    So \(D_4\) corresponds to 
    \begin{equation}
        \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-D4}
        \tikz[baseline=(current bounding box.east)]{ \draw (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw (1, 0) -- ++ (30:1); \draw (1, 0) -- ++ (-30:1); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] ($(1, 0) + (30:1)$) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] ($(1, 0) + (-30:1)$) circle [radius = 0.075]; }
    \end{equation}
    and \(D_5\) corresponds to
    \begin{equation}
        \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-D5}
        \tikz[baseline=(current bounding box.east)]{ \draw (-1, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw (1, 0) -- ++ (30:1); \draw (1, 0) -- ++ (-30:1); \draw[dynkin node] (-1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] ($(1, 0) + (30:1)$) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] ($(1, 0) + (-30:1)$) circle [radius = 0.075]; }
    \end{equation}
    In general, \(D_n\) corresponds to
    \begin{equation}
        \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-Dn}
        \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (-1, 0) -- (0.3, 0); \draw (0.7, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dotted] (0.3, 0) -- (0.7, 0); \draw (1, 0) -- ++ (30:1); \draw (1, 0) -- ++ (-30:1); \draw[dynkin node] (-1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] ($(1, 0) + (30:1)$) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] ($(1, 0) + (-30:1)$) circle [radius = 0.075]; }
    \end{equation}
    
    The exceptional groups also have Dynkin diagrams.
    For \(E_n\) (\(n = 6, 7, 8\)) the Dynkin diagram consists of a chain of \(n - 1\) nodes with an extra node branching off three from the end, so \(E_6\) corresponds to
    \begin{equation}
        \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-E6}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(current bounding box.east)]
            \draw (0, 0) -- (4, 0);
            \draw (2, 0) -- (2, 1);
            \foreach \x in {0, ..., 4} {
                \draw[dynkin node] (\x, 0) circle [radius = 0.075];
            }
            \draw[dynkin node] (2, 1) circle [radius = 0.075];
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{equation}
    \(E_7\) corresponds to
    \begin{equation}
        \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-E7}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(current bounding box.east)]
            \draw (0, 0) -- (5, 0);
            \draw (3, 0) -- (3, 1);
            \foreach \x in {0, ..., 5} {
                \draw[dynkin node] (\x, 0) circle [radius = 0.075];
            }
            \draw[dynkin node] (3, 1) circle [radius = 0.075];
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{equation}
    and \(E_8\) to
    \begin{equation}
        \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-E8}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(current bounding box.east)]
            \draw (0, 0) -- (6, 0);
            \draw (4, 0) -- (4, 1);
            \foreach \x in {0, ..., 6} {
                \draw[dynkin node] (\x, 0) circle [radius = 0.075];
            }
            \draw[dynkin node] (4, 1) circle [radius = 0.075];
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{equation}
    
    The Dynkin diagram for \(F_4\) is
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-F4}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[double, ->-=0.65, >=To] (1, 0) -- (2, 0); \draw (2, 0) -- (3, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (2, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (3, 0) circle [radius = 0.075];}
    .
    
    The Dynkin diagram for \(G_2\) is
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-G2}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw[->-=0.65, >={To[width=0.3cm, length=0.14cm]}] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[yshift=0.035cm] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[yshift=-0.035cm] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; \draw[dynkin node] (1, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; }
    .
    
    Notice that for some low-rank cases the Dynkin diagrams are degenerate, for example \(A_1\) and \(B_1\) both correspond to
    \tikzsetnextfilename{dynkin-B1}
    \tikz[baseline=-2.5pt]{ \draw[dynkin node] (0, 0) circle [radius = 0.075]; }
    which reflects the fact that \(A_1 \cong B_1\), which is to say \(SU(2) \cong SO(3)\), a fact that will be important later.
    It also explains why the \(E_n\) exceptional groups start at \(E_6\), sinice the Dynkin diagram for \(E_5\) is the same as for \(D_5\), and the Dynkin diagram for \(E_4\) is the same as for \(A_4\).
