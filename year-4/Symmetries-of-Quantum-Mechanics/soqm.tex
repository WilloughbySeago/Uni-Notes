    \part{Applications to Quantum Mechanics}
    \chapter{Quantum Mechanics Synopsis}
    In this chapter we give a short synopsis of quantum mechanics.
    For more details see the notes from principles of quantum mechanics.
    
    \section{Rules of Quantum Mechanics}
    A state is described by a vector in some complex Hilbert space, \(\hilbert\), (\cref{def:hilbert space}).
    We denote states with bra-ket notation, in particular a state is denoted by a ket, such as \(\ket{\Psi}\).
    This corresponds to some physical state which follows a dynamical equation.
    For the non-relativistic case the dynamical equation is the (time independent) \defineindex{Schrödinger equation}:
    \begin{equation}
        \operator{H}\ket{\Psi} = E\ket{\Psi}.
    \end{equation}
    Here \(\operator{H}\) is an operator, called the \defineindex{Hamiltonian}, and \(E\) is the energy eigenvalue associated with the eigenstate \(\ket{\Psi}\).
    
    The Hamiltonian, and indeed all observables, are Hermitian operators on \(\hilbert\), so \(\operator{H}^\hermit = \operator{H}\).
    This is required so that the observed value, \(E\), is real, which all eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are since
    \begin{equation}
        E\braket{\Psi}{\Psi} = \bra{\Psi}\operator{H}\ket{\Psi} = \bra{\Psi}\operator{H}^\hermit\ket{\Psi} = \bra{\Psi}H\ket{\Psi}^* = E^*\braket{\Psi}{\Psi} = E^*\braket{\Psi}{\Psi},
    \end{equation}
    which can only hold if \(E^* = E\), so \(E \in \reals\).
    Further, for a Hermitian operator eigenstates with different eigenvalues are orthogonal since
    \begin{equation}
        E_{\Psi}\braket{\Phi}{\Psi} = \bra{\Phi}\operator{H}\ket{\Psi} = \bra{\Phi}\operator{H}^\hermit\ket{\Psi} = \bra{\Psi}\operator{H}\ket{\Phi} = E_{\Phi}\braket{\Psi}{\Phi}.
    \end{equation}
    Hence,
    \begin{equation}
        (E_{\Psi} - E_{\Phi})\braket{\Psi}{\Phi} = 0,
    \end{equation}
    so either \(E_{\Psi} = E_{\Phi}\) or \(\braket{\Psi}{\Phi} = 0\).
    
    In quantum mechanics we can only determine the probability of certain processes occurring.
    One important case is the probability that a system transitions from state \(\ket{\Psi}\) to state \(\ket{\Phi}\), which is given by
    \begin{equation}
        P(\Psi \to \Phi) = \abs{A_{\Psi\to\Phi}}^2, \qqwhere A_{\Psi\to\Phi} = \braket{\Phi}{\Psi}.
    \end{equation}
    In order for the probabilities to be properly normalised we must have \(\braket{\Psi}{\Psi} = \braket{\Phi}{\Phi} = 1\).
    
    \section{From hamiltonian to the Schrödinger Equation}
    We can often find the Hamiltonian, up to ambiguity in operator ordering, from the classical case by replacing observables with the associated operators.
    The distinction being that operators don't commute.
    The most famous example of this being the \defineindex{Heisenberg commutation relation} for the position operator, \(\vecoperator{x}\), and momentum operator, \(\vecoperator{p}\):
    \begin{equation}
        \commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{p}_j} = i\hbar \delta_{ij}, \qquad \commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{x}_j} = 0, \qqand \commutator{\operator{p}_i}{\operator{p}_j} = 0.
    \end{equation}
    From these relations we can derive the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, \(\Delta x \Delta p \ge \hbar/2\).
    
    For a non-relativistic particle of mass \(m\) we can write the Hamiltonian as a kinetic part, \(T\), and a potential part, \(V\), which we assume to be a function of only the position (and not the momentum):
    \begin{equation}
        \operator{H} = \operator{T} + \operator{V} = \frac{\vecoperator{p}^2}{2m} + V(\vecoperator{x}).
    \end{equation}
    
    We wish to use this to perform calculations.
    To do so we need to choose a representation, which corresponds to choosing a maximal set of commuting operators.
    The most common choice is to work in the position representation, where we have as a basis states \(\ket{\vv{x}}\), for which
    \begin{equation}
        \operator{x}_i\ket{\vv{x}} = x_i\ket{\vv{x}}.
    \end{equation}
    Completeness of the Hilbert space ensures that we can write the identity as an integral (or sum in the discrete case) over projection operators:
    \begin{equation}
        \ident_x = \int \dl{^3x} \, \ket{\vv{x}}\bra{\vv{x}}.
    \end{equation}
    Choosing the basis to be orthonormal we have
    \begin{equation}
        \braket{\vv{x}}{\vv{x}'} = \delta(\vv{x} - \vv{x}'),
    \end{equation}
    where \(\delta\) is the Dirac delta distribution.
    
    Using the completeness relation, \(\ident_x = \int \dl{^3x}\,\ket{\vv{x}}\bra{\vv{x}}\), we have
    \begin{equation}
        \ket{\Psi} = \int \dl{^3x} \, \ket{\vv{x}}\braket{\vv{x}}{\Psi} = \int \dl{^3x} \, \Psi(\vv{x})\ket{\vv{x}}
    \end{equation}
    where we define \(\Psi(\vv{x}) \coloneqq \braket{\vv{x}}{\Psi}\).
    
    In the position representation the momentum operator is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \operator{p}_j|_{x} \to -i\hbar\partial_j, \qqwhere \partial_j \coloneqq \diffp{}{x_j}.
    \end{equation}
    By this we mean
    \begin{equation}
        \bra{x}\operator{p}_j\ket{\Psi} = -i\hbar\diffp{\psi(x)}{x_j}.
    \end{equation}
    
    Starting with the Schrödinger equation we act on the left with a bra from the position eigenbasis, \(\bra{\vv{x}}\), giving \(\bra{\vv{x}}\operator{H}\ket{\Psi} = E\braket{\vv{x}}{\Psi} = E\Psi(\vv{x})\).
    Applying the completeness relation to the left hand side of the Schrödinger equation we get
    \begin{equation}
        \int \dl{^3x} \, \bra{\vv{x}} \operator{H} \ket{\vv{x}'}\braket{x'}{\Psi}.
    \end{equation}
    Now inserting the Hamiltonian we get two terms:
    \begin{equation}
        \int \dl{^3x} \sum_{j = 1}^{3} \frac{1}{2m} \bra{\vv{x}}\operator{p}_j\ket{\vv{x}'}\braket{\vv{x}'}{\Psi} + \int \dl{^3x} \bra{\vv{x}} V(\vecoperator{x}) \ket{\vv{x}'}\braket{\vv{x}'}{\Psi}.
    \end{equation}
    We now use the fact that \(\bra{\vv{x}}V(\vecoperator{x})\ket{\vv{x}'} = V(\vv{x}')\braket{\vv{x}}{\vv{x}'} = V(\vv{x}')\delta(\vv{x} - \vv{x}')\) and \(\operator{p}_j \to -i\hbar\partial_j\),
    \begin{equation}
        \int \dl{^3x} \sum_{j = 1}^{3} \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \delta(\vv{x} - \vv{x}') \diffp[2]{\psi}{x_j} + \int \dl{^3x} V(\vv{x})\delta(\vv{x} - \vv{x}')\braket{\vv{x}'}{\Psi}.
    \end{equation}
    Now using the sifting property of the Dirac delta distribution we have
    \begin{equation}
        \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \laplacian + V(\vv{x}) \right] \psi(\vv{x}) = E\Psi(\vv{x}).
    \end{equation}

    A common application is calculating transition matrices, \(A_{\Psi \to \Phi}\).
    These arise when a system is described by the Hamiltonian \(\operator{H} = \operator{H}_0 + \operator{H}_{\mathrm{trans}}\).
    If \(\ket{\Psi}\) and \(\ket{\Phi}\) are eigenstates of \(\operator{H}_0\) then we define
    \begin{equation}
        A_{\Psi\to\Phi} \coloneqq \bra{\Phi} \operator{H}_{\mathrm{trans}} \ket{\Psi} + \text{higher order terms}.
    \end{equation}
    This is called \defineindex{Fermi's golden rule}.
    It gives reasonable results for sufficiently small perturbations.
    
    \section{Symmetries and Conservation Laws}
    \begin{thm}{Noether's Theorem}{}
        Each symmetry has an associated conservation law and each conservation law can be seen as the consequence of some symmetry.
    \end{thm}
    
    Suppose we have a system governed by the Hamiltonian \(\operator{H}\).
    If the system is invariant under a unitary symmetry, \(U \in \unitary(\hilbert)\), that is \(\ket{\Psi}\) and \(U\ket{\Psi}\) describe the same state, then
    \begin{equation}
        \bra{\Phi} \operator{H} \ket{\Psi} = \bra{\Phi} U^\hermit \operator{H} U \ket{\Psi}.
    \end{equation}
    This can only be the case if \(U^\hermit \operator{H} U = \operator{H}\), and so we see that \(\commutator{U}{\operator{H}} = 0\).
    That is the unitary symmetry transformation commutes with the Hamiltonian.
    We can write the unitary transformation in terms of a generator, \(T\), as \(U = \exp(i\alpha T)\).
    We then see that the generator must commute with the Hamiltonian, \(\commutator{T}{\operator{H}} = 0\).
    
    Heisenberg's equation of motion for a time independent operator, \(T\), (\(\partial_t T = 0\)) is
    \begin{equation}
        \diff*{\expected{T}}{t} = i\expected{\commutator{\operator{H}}{T}},
    \end{equation}
    where \(\expected{A} \coloneqq \bra{\Psi} A \ket{A}\) denotes the expectation value of an operator.
    This shows us that \(\expected{T}\) is a conserved quantity if it commutes with the hamiltonian.
    
    We therefore conclude that the symmetry generated by \(T\) is linked with a conservation law for \(\expected{T}\).
    
    There are many categories of symmetries worth considering.
    We list some important examples now.
    
    \begin{exm}{Poincar\'e Group}{}
        \begin{rmk}
            In this example we work in units where \(c = 1\).
        \end{rmk}
        The \defineindex{Lorentz group}, \(\orthogonal(1, 3)\), is the group preserving the metric\footnote{We use the metric sign convention \(({+}{-}{-}{-})\).} in special relativity, that is it preserves \(x^\mu x_\mu = t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2\), by this we mean if \(\Lambda \in \orthogonal(1, 3)\) then the transformation \(x^\mu \to x'^\mu = \Lambda_{\mu\nu}x^\nu\) doesn't change \(x^\mu x_\mu\).
        The \defineindex{Poincar\'e group} is the Lorentz group and spacetime translations, it is given by the semi-direct product \(\orthogonal(1, 3) \ltimes \reals^{1,3}\).
        
        In the rest frame of some observer the Poincar\'e group reduces to the rotation group, \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) (or \(\specialUnitary(2)\)), spatial translations, and temporal translations.
        These all have associated conservation laws.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Symmetry under rotations, \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\), corresponds to conservation of angular momentum.
            \item Symmetry under spatial translations, \(\reals^3\), corresponds to conservation of momentum.
            \item Symmetry under temporal translations, \(\reals\), corresponds to conservation of energy.
        \end{itemize}
        Note that the last two can be combined in to symmetry under spacetime translations, \(\reals^{1,3}\), corresponding to conservation of four-momentum, \(p^\mu = (E, \vv{p})\).
        
        When we consider different inertial frames then we get additional symmetries given by boosting between frames.
        All boosts can be given as a combination of boosts along the three coordinate axes.
        Correspondingly \(\dim(\orthogonal(3)) = 3\) generalises to \(\dim(\orthogonal(1, 3)) = 6\).
        The Lie algebra associated with \(\orthogonal(1, 3)\) is rank 2, since the generators of rotations commute with the generators of boosts.
    \end{exm}
    
    \begin{exm}{CPT Symmetry}{}
        There are three fundamental symmetries in particle physics that one may wish to consider.
        These are
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \define{Parity symmetry}\index{parity symmetry}, \(\Psym(t, x, y, z) = (t, -x, -y, -z)\), that is \(\Psym \vv{r} = -\vv{r}\).
            The parity is conserved by any interactions not involving the weak force.
            \item \define{Time symmetry}\index{time symmetry}, \(\Tsym(t, x, y, z) = (-t, x, y, z)\), that is \(\Tsym t = -t\).
            This is violated slightly in weak interactions, which may well be responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.
            \item \define{Charge symmetry}\index{charge symmetry}, \(\Csym p = \bar{p}\), where \(p\) is any particle and \(\bar{p}\) is its antiparticle.
            This is again conserved up to weak interactions.
        \end{itemize}
        We can combine these into one single symmetry, \({\Csym}{\Psym}{\Tsym}\), where we exchange all particles for their antiparticles, reflect everything through the origin and reverse time. 
        As far as we know \({\Csym}{\Psym}{\Tsym}\) is always conserved.
    \end{exm}
    
    \begin{exm}{Gauge Symmetries}{}
        Local symmetries of Lie groups lead to charge conservation.
        Here we are being generic with the word charge, allowing for electric charge, but also other properties like colour and isospin.
        At high energies the standard model exhibits a symmetry described by \(\specialUnitary(3)_{\mathrm{c}} \directproduct \specialUnitary(2)_{\mathrm{L}} \directproduct \unitary(1)_{\mathrm{Y}}\).
        The \(\mathrm{c}\) stands for colour charge, which is conserved under \(\specialUnitary(3)\) symmetry (3 because there are three colours).
        The \(\mathrm{L}\) stands for left-handed, and the \(\mathrm{Y}\) for hypercharge.
        At lower energies the Higgs mechanism reduces the symmetry to \(\specialUnitary(3)_{\mathrm{c}} \directproduct \unitary(1)_{\mathrm{em}}\).
        Here \(\unitary(1)_{\mathrm{em}}\) describes conservation of electric charge.
    \end{exm}

    \chapter{Physics of Angular Momentum}
    So far we have studied \(\specialUnitaryLie(2)\).
    We have seen how to construct representations and the eigenvalues of the \(J_3\) generator and \(J^2\) Casimir element.
    We've seen that the Casimir number, \(C_2(j) = j(j + 1)\), or the value of \(j\), can be used to label the eigenstates, of the mutual basis, in order to lift degeneracy we need a second label which we take to be \(m\), the projection of the spin on the \(z\)-axis.
    The value of \(j\) is representation dependent, but frame independent, since it is associated with a Casimir element which commutes with all generators.
    The value of \(m\) is frame dependent since \(J_3\) is not a Casimir operator.
    
    \section{Basics of Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics}
    
    Recall that the \defineindex{orbital angular momentum operator} is defined as
    \begin{equation}
        \vecoperator{L} \coloneqq \vecoperator{x} \times \vecoperator{p}, \qqor \operator{L}_a = (\vecoperator{x} \times \vecoperator{p})_a = \varepsilon_{abc}\operator{x}_a\operator{p}_c.
    \end{equation}
    As well as the orbital angular momentum we have the \define{intrinsic angular momentum}\index{intrinsic angular momentum|see{spin}}, or \defineindex{spin}, with the associated operator \(\vecoperator{S}\).
    Combined, these give the \defineindex{total angular momentum operator}, \(\vecoperator{J} = \vecoperator{L} + \vecoperator{S}\).
    If there is no spin or no orbital angular momentum it is common to simply talk about the total angular momentum, \(\vecoperator{J}\), in place of the non-zero angular momentum operator.
    
    Consider the commutation relation for two components of the orbital angular momentum operator.
    For this derivation we will need the canonical commutation relations,
    \begin{equation}
        \commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{p}_j} = i\hbar\delta_{ij}, \qquad \commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{x}_j} = 0, \qqand \commutator{\operator{p}_i}{\operator{p}_j} = 0,
    \end{equation}
    as well as the commutation identities
    \begin{equation}
        \commutator{AB}{C} = A\commutator{B}{C} + \commutator{A}{C}B, \qqand \commutator{A}{BC} = B\commutator{A}{C} + \commutator{A}{B}C,
    \end{equation}
    which can be proven by expanding the commutators.
    Finally we need the identity
    \begin{equation}
        \varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon_{klm} = \delta_{il}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{jl}.
    \end{equation}
    Combing these we have
    \begin{align}
        \commutator{\operator{L}_a}{\operator{L}_b} &= \commutator{\varepsilon_{aij}\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_k}{\varepsilon_{bkl}\operator{x}_k\operator{p}_l}\\
        &= \varepsilon_{aij}\varepsilon_{bkl}\commutator{\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_j}{\operator{x}_k\operator{p}_l}\\
        &= \varepsilon_{aij}\varepsilon_{bkl}(\operator{x}_i\commutator{\operator{p}_j}{\operator{x}_k\operator{p}_l} + \commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{x}_k\operator{p}_l}\operator{p}_j)\\
        &= \varepsilon_{aij}\varepsilon_{bkl}(\operator{x}_i\operator{x_j}\commutator{\operator{p}_j}{\operator{p}_l} + \operator{x}_i\commutator{\operator{p}_j}{\operator{x}_k}\operator{p}_l\notag\\
        &\qquad+ \operator{x}_k\commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{p}_l}\operator{p}_k + \commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{x}_k}\operator{p}_l\operator{p}_j)\\
        &= \varepsilon_{aij}\varepsilon_{bkl}(\operator{x}_i\commutator{\operator{p}_j}{\operator{x}_k}\operator{p}_l + \operator{x}_k\commutator{\operator{x}_i}{\operator{p}_l}\operator{p}_j)\\
        &= \varepsilon_{aij}\varepsilon_{bkl}(-i\hbar\delta_{jk}\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_l + i\hbar\delta_{il}\operator{x}_k\operator{p}_j)\\
        &= -i\hbar\varepsilon_{aij}\varepsilon_{jlb}\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_l + i\hbar\varepsilon_{jai}\varepsilon_{ibk}\operator{x}_k\operator{p}_j\\
        &= -i\hbar(\delta_{al}\delta_{ib} - \delta_{ab}\delta_{il})\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_l + i\hbar(\delta_{jb}\delta_{ak} - \delta_{jk}\delta_{ab})\operator{x}_k\operator{p}_j\\
        &= -i\hbar(\operator{x}_b\operator{p}_a - \delta_{ab}\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_i) + i\hbar(\operator{x}_a\operator{p}_b - \delta_{ab}\operator{x}_j\operator{p}_j)\\
        &= i\hbar(\operator{x}_a\operator{p}_b - \operator{x}_b\operator{p}_a).
    \end{align}
    Now consider \(\varepsilon_{abc}\operator{L}_c\):
    \begin{align}
        \varepsilon_{abc}\operator{L}_c &= \varepsilon_{abc}\varepsilon_{cij}\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_j\\
        &= (\delta_{ai}\delta_{bj} - \delta_{aj}\delta_{bi})\operator{x}_i\operator{p}_j\\
        &= \operator{x}_a\operator{p}_b - \operator{x}_b\operator{p}_a.
    \end{align}
    So we see that
    \begin{equation}
        \commutator{\operator{L}_a}{\operator{L}_b} = i\hbar\varepsilon_{abc}\operator{L}_c,
    \end{equation}
    which means that the angular momentum operators satisfy the \(\specialUnitaryLie(2)\) commutation relations, up to an unimportant factor of \(\hbar\).
    
    We can now ascribe a physical meaning to the value of \(j\).
    Consider the Wigner \(D\)-matrix \(D^j(\vartheta, 0, 0)_{mm'} = \e^{-im\vartheta}\delta_{mm'}\).
    We see that
    \begin{equation}
        D^j(2\pi, 0, 0)_{mm'} = \e^{-2\pi i m}\delta_{mm'} = (\e^{-i\pi})^{2m} = (-1)^{2m} = (-1)^{2j}
    \end{equation}
    where we've used the fact that \((-1)^{2m} = 1\) if \(m\) is an integer and \((-1)^{2m} = -1\) if \(m\) is a half-integer, and \(m\) is an integer or half-integer precisely when \(j\) is.
    From this we see that if a spin 1/2 particle is rotated \ang{360} its state picks up a minus sign, and another \ang{360} rotation is needed in order to return to the original state.
    This means that to obtain an invariant scalar we need an even number of fermions so that these minus signs cancel.
    
    For a system which is spherically symmetric the \emph{total} angular momentum must be conserved.
    For a system of a single particle this means \(\vv{J} = \vv{L} + \vv{S}\) is conserved.
    For a system of two particles with angular momenta \(\vv{J}^{(i)}\) this means \(\vv{J} = \vv{J}^{(1)} + \vv{J}^{(2)}\) is conserved.
    For a system of multiple particles their individual angular are compatible, in the sense that \(\commutator{\operator{J}_i^{(a)}}{\operator{J}_j^{(b)}} = 0\) for all \(a \ne b\).
    A simple example of a system with multiple sources of angular momentum is a particle with orbital angular momentum and spin 1/2, so the spin is represented by \(\ket{s = 1/2}\).
    Say this particle is in an \(l = 1\) state, so the position dependent part of the state is \(\ket{\Psi_{l=1}}\), then we can write its state as \(\ket{\Psi_{l=1}} \directproduct \ket{s = 1/2} = \ket{j = 1/2} \directsum \ket{j = 3/2}\), where we have used the Clebsch--Gordan series for \(\rho_{1} \directproduct \rho_{1/2} = \rho_{1/2} \directsum \rho_{3/2}\).
    Notice that, despite one of the sources having angular momentum 1, there is no way the total angular momentum can be 1, it can only be 1/2 or 3/2.
    
    \section{Wigner--Eckart Theorem}
    \begin{dfn}{Tensor Operator}{}
        Let \(G\) be a Lie group, \(\rho\) a representation of \(G\), and \(\rho_c\) an irreducible representation of \(G\).
        We say that \(T_{m_c}^c\) is a \defineindex{tensor operator} in the irreducible representation, \(c\), if it transforms as
        \begin{equation}
            \rho(g)T_{m_c}^{c}\rho(g)^\hermit = \rho_c(g)_{m_cm_c'}T_{m_c'}^{c},
        \end{equation}
        with summation over \(m_c'\) implied.
    \end{dfn}
    
    An example of a tensor operator is the momentum operator, \(\operator{p}_i\), which transforms as \(\operator{p}_i \to R_{ij}\operator{p}_j\), where \(R_{ij}\) is in the fundamental representation of \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) (that is the \(j = 1\) representation).
    We call objects that transform under the \(j = 1\) representation of \(\specialOrthogonal(3)\) vectors, and hence this is sometimes referred to as the \defineindex{vector representation}.
    Similarly the trivial representation is the scalar representation, since it leaves everything unchanged, which is how scalars transform.
    
    The direct product of irreducible representations will, in general, decompose into a direct sum of irreducible representations.
    This means that, given two irreducible representations, \(a\) and \(b\), we can decompose the tensor product as a sum over irreducible representations, \(c\).
    We will use the notation of \(\specialUnitaryLie(2)\) here, but this idea generalises to many other Lie algebras in a natural way.
    Suppose we have two states, \(\ket{a, m_a}\), and \(\ket{b, m_b}\).
    Consider their direct product, \(\ket{a, m_a} \directproduct \ket{b, m_b} = \ket{a, m_a \directproduct b, m_b}\).
    We can insert completeness giving
    \begin{align}
        \ket{a, m_a} \directproduct \ket{b, m_b} = \sum_{c, m_c, i} \ket{c, m_c}\bra{c, m_c}(\ket{a, m_a} \directproduct \ket{b, m_b}),
    \end{align}
    where \(i = 1, \dotsc, m_{ab}^c\) is the multiplicity of the representation \(c\) in the decomposition of \(a \directproduct b\).
    If \(m_{ab}^c = 0, 1\) then we call the group \defineindex{simply reducible}.
    In this case we may write
    \begin{equation}
        \ket{a, m_a} \directproduct \ket{b, m_b} = \sum_{c, m_c} \ket{c, m_c} \bra{c, m_c}(\ket{a, m_a} \directproduct \ket{b, m_b}),
    \end{equation}
    where representations with multiplicity 0 are implicitly left out of the sum.
    We will only consider simply reducible groups.
    In more terse notation we can write this as
    \begin{equation}
        \ket{a, m_a \directproduct b, m_b} = \sum_{c, m_c} \ket{c, m_c} \braket{c, m_c}{a, m_a \directproduct b, m_b}.
    \end{equation}
    We can identify the final bra-ket as simply a constant for fixed values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(m_a\), \(m_b\), and \(m_c\).
    This is useful since we can compute it once and then not worry about it again, giving rise to the following definition.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Clebsch--Gordan Coefficient}{}
        Let \(a\) and \(b\) be irreducible representations of some Lie group and let \(c\) index the irreducible representations in the decomposition of \(a \directproduct b\).
        Then we define the \defineindex{Clebsch--Gordan coefficients}, \(\clebschgordan{m_c}{m_a}{m_b}{c}{a}{b}\), are defined as the coefficients appearing in the decomposition of \(\ket{a, m_a} \directproduct \ket{b, m_b}\):
        \begin{equation}
            \clebschgordan{m_c}{m_a}{m_b}{c}{a}{b} \coloneqq \bra{c, m_c} (\ket{a, m_a} \directproduct \ket{b, m_b}) = \braket{c, m_c}{a, m_a \directproduct b, m_b}.
        \end{equation}
    \end{dfn}
    \begin{wrn}
        The Clebsch--Gordan coefficients are defined only up to a phase.
        Therefore there is a phase convention when we give their values.
        The common phase convention is the \defineindex{Condon--Shortley phase convention}, which is such that the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients are real for \(\specialUnitary(2)\), this is what we will use.
    \end{wrn}
    
    \begin{thm}{Wigner--Eckart Theorem}{}
        For simply reducible groups the matrix elements of a tensor operator are proportional to a Clebsch--Gordan coefficient.
        That is,
        \begin{equation}
            \bra{c, m_c} T_{m_a}^a\ket{b, m_b} = \clebschgordan{m_c}{m_a}{m_b}{c}{a}{b} \bra{c} |T^a| \ket{b},
        \end{equation}
        where the constant of proportionality, \(\bra{c} |T^a| \ket{b}\), is called the \defineindex{reduced matrix element}, and is independent of \(m_a\), \(m_b\), and \(m_c\).
        
        \begin{proof}
            The state \(T^a_{m_a}\ket{b, m_b}\) transforms like a direct product of two states.
            We can see this by considering its transformation under some unitary representation, \(\rho\):
            \begin{align}
                \rho(g) T^a_{m_a} \ket{b, m_b} = \rho(g) T^{a}_{m_a} \rho(g)^\hermit \rho(g) \ket{b, m_b}\\
                &= \rho_a(g)_{m_am_a'}T^a_{m_a'} \rho_b(g)_{m_b'}\ket{b, m_b'}.
            \end{align}
            Here we have used \(\rho(g)^\hermit\rho(g) = \ident\) for a unitary representation, as well as the definition of the tensor operator's transformation law, and that the state \(\ket{j, m}\) transforms under the representation \(\rho_j\).
            
            By the definition of Clebsch--Gordan coefficients we know that
            \begin{equation}
                \ket{j_1, m_1 \directproduct j_2, m_2} = \clebschgordan{M'}{m_1}{m_2}{J'}{j_1}{j_2}\ket{J', M'},
            \end{equation}
            with summation over \(J'\) and \(M'\) implied.
            We therefore have that
            \begin{equation}
                T_{m_a}^{a}\ket{b, m_b} \propto \clebschgordan{m_c'}{m_a}{m_b}{c'}{a}{b}\ket{c, m_c'}.
            \end{equation}
            Since this is the only way to have \(T_{m_a}^a\ket{b, m_b}\) transform like a product state.
            
            Now apply \(\bra{c, m_c}\) to this relation and we get
            \begin{align}
                \bra{c, m_c}T_{m_a}^{a}\ket{b, m_b} &\propto \clebschgordan{m_c'}{m_a}{m_b}{c'}{a}{b} \braket{c, m_c}{c, m_c'}\\
                &= \clebschgordan{m_c'}{m_a}{m_b}{c'}{a}{b} \delta_{cc'}\delta_{m_cm_c'}\\
                &= \clebschgordan{m_c}{m_a}{m_b}{c}{a}{b}.
            \end{align}
            The constant of proportionality in this equation is what we define as the reduced matrix element, \(\bra{c}|T^a|\ket{b}\).
        \end{proof}
    \end{thm}
    
    The Wigner--Eckart theorem is useful since it allows us to compute a single matrix element, \(\bra{c, m_c}T_{m_a}^a\ket{b, m_b}\), which we can use to compute \(\bra{c}|T^a|\ket{b}\), and then all other matrix elements are simply proportional to this, and the constants of proportionality are known.
    Things get even simpler if we only consider the ratio of matrix elements, since in this case we don't even need to compute the reduced matrix element.
    This is useful to calculate, for example, relative decay times of particles when the particles are part of a representation of some internal symmetry group.
    This occurs for the \(\specialUnitary(2)\) isospin symmetry where we exchange up-type quarks and down-type quarks in pions.
    
    To summarise this section, the matrix element \(\bra{c, m_c}T_{m_a}^{a}\ket{b, m_b}\) is non-zero only if the irreducible representation appears in the Clebsch--Gordan series decomposition of \(a \directproduct b\) with non-zero multiplicity.
    The direction of the matirx element is determined completely by the Clebsch--Gordan coefficient.
